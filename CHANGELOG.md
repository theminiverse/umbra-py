# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `umbra_py.viz` module for visualizing search results.
  - `item_to_feature`, `items_to_featurecollection`, `write_geojson`:
    convert items to GeoJSON for QGIS, leafmap, Earth Engine, geopandas,
    deck.gl, or any other tool that reads GeoJSON. The third coordinate of
    Umbra's 3D footprints is stripped so they render in 2D viewers.
  - `footprint_map`, `save_footprint_map`: build an interactive Folium map
    of one or more acquisitions, with auto-fit bounds and a metadata popup
    per item. Requires the `viz` extra.
  - `UmbraItem.to_geojson()` convenience method.
- `umbra map` CLI subcommand: search the catalog and write an interactive
  HTML map (`--out footprints.html`) or a GeoJSON FeatureCollection
  (`--out footprints.geojson`) to disk.
- SAR image overlays on the Folium map.
  - `image_overlay(item)`: stream a downsampled preview of an item's GEC
    cloud-optimized GeoTIFF via HTTP range requests (no full download),
    apply a percentile contrast stretch to handle SAR's wide dynamic
    range, reproject to lat/lon if needed, and return a Folium
    `ImageOverlay` ready to drop onto any map.
  - `footprint_map(items, imagery=True)` / `umbra map --imagery`: one-call
    convenience that combines footprints with the SAR imagery. Each
    overlay is embedded as a base64 PNG so the resulting HTML file is
    self-contained — no tile server required.
  - The `viz` extra now also pulls in `rasterio` and `numpy` for the
    image-overlay path; folium-only users are unaffected.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-22

Initial release. Discovery + download core for Umbra's open SAR data.

### Added
- `UmbraCatalog`: search Umbra's static STAC catalog by bounding box, date
  range, and product type, with date-based pruning of the catalog tree so a
  constrained search only fetches relevant day catalogs.
- `UmbraItem`: lightweight dataclass over STAC items with metadata accessors
  (platform, product type, polarizations, resolution, incidence angle, …),
  bbox derivation from 3D geometry, and human-readable summaries.
- Anonymous HTTPS downloads (`download_url`, `download_asset`, `download_item`)
  with resume support and progress callbacks.
- `umbra` CLI with `search`, `info`, and `download` commands.
- Optional `convert` extra: `sicd_to_amplitude_geotiff` for inspection-quality
  amplitude extraction from SICD.
- Project scaffolding: Apache 2.0 license, packaging, CI, tests, and docs.
